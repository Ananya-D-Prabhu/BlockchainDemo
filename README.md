# BlockchainDemo
Interactive Blockchain Demo: An interactive, educational web application that demonstrates how blockchain technology works. Learn about proof-of-work mining, transactions, consensus mechanisms, and distributed ledgers through hands-on exploration.

## 🌟 Features
### Core Blockchain Functionality
⛏️ Proof-of-Work Mining - Real cryptographic hash calculations with adjustable difficulty
🔐 SHA-256 Hashing - Each block secured with cryptographic hashing
🔗 Immutable Chain - Blocks linked together through previous hash references
✅ Chain Validation - Automatic verification of blockchain integrity
⏱️ Timestamps - Each block records its creation time

## Network & Peers
👥 Multi-Peer System - Each peer maintains their own independent blockchain
💰 Individual Balances - Calculated from complete transaction history
🔄 Consensus Mechanism - Longest chain rule for network synchronization
🌐 Decentralized Network - Simulate a distributed blockchain network

## Transaction Management
💸 Send Transactions - Transfer coins between peers
📋 Transaction Pool - Pending transactions waiting to be mined
💵 Transaction Fees - Incentivize miners with fees
📊 Transaction History - View all transactions in each block

## User Experience
🎓 Interactive Tutorial - 6-step guided learning experience
🎨 Modern UI - Beautiful gradients and smooth animations
📱 Responsive Design - Works on desktop and mobile devices
⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts - Quick actions for power users
🔍 Block Explorer - View complete blockchain for any peer

## 🧪 Understanding the Code
Block Class
Represents a single block in the blockchain:

Calculates cryptographic hash
Implements proof-of-work mining
Stores transactions and metadata

Blockchain Class
Manages the entire chain:

Creates genesis block
Validates chain integrity
Handles pending transactions
Implements consensus rules

Peer Class
Represents network participants:

Maintains own blockchain
Calculates balance from transactions
Can sync with other peers
